# ASR Post Editor

This tool facilitates editing transcripts that are generated by ASR (Auto Speech Recognition) model.

## Build

Get started with building the tool by ensuring you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Qt 6 Installation:**
   - Install Qt 6 on your system, including the base and multimedia packages. Obtain it from [Qt's official website](https://www.qt.io/download).

2. **Codec Support:**
   - Ensure your system has the necessary codec support for media playback. The required codecs may vary based on your operating system.

3. **C++ Compiler:**
   - Install a C++ compiler that aligns with the Qt toolchain you've chosen for installation.

4. **CMake:**
   - Make sure CMake is installed on your system.

### Additional Notes:
* Make sure that CMake can locate the Qt6 multimedia package CMakeLists file.
* Clone the repository or download it as a zip archive.
* Qt creator can be used to skip steps below and build the tool.

To Build with MSVC (Default):
```shell
cd Transcriptor

# The '-j flag' speeds up the build process using multiple jobs.
# Adjust the number of jobs based on your system's virtual cores.

cmake -B build .
cmake --build build --target clean -j<no_of_jobs>
```

To Build with MinGW:
```shell
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build .
cmake --build build --target clean -j<no_of_jobs>
cd .\build\
mingw32-make
cd .\output\asr-post-editor.exe
```
* QT deployment tool is mandatory for MSVC and MingW (QT Creator can ignore)
